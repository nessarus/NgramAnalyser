# NgramAnalyser

The N-gram Analyser is a student project developed during the CITS1001 Object-oriented Programming and Software Engineering course in University of Western Australia during semester one of 2017. The project uses skeleton code provided as part of course material from the university. 

In preparing for the project, a secondary project for an address book was also completed. This was also included in the repository.  

Project 1: Address Book
  Manage an AddressBook of Person contacts
  
Project 2: N-gram Analyser
  This program analyses the frequency with which distinct n-grams, of length n, appear in an input string. 
  The program is a set of classes interacting with each other. For the uses cases see the ProjectTest class.
